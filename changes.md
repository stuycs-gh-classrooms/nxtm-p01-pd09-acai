Cool things:

    It's cool that you're adding things like bosses and barriers.

Clarifying Qs:

    What are you going to do for a mouse event listener?
    What are you going to do for your win/lose event?
    Do you have a class for your enemies?

Suggestions:

    You can add a mouse movement listener that allows your ship to follow the players' mouse.

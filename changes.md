Cool things:

    It's cool that you're adding things like bosses and barriers.

Clarifying Qs:

    What are you going to do for a mouse event listener?
    What are you going to do for your win/lose event?
    Do you have a class for your enemies?

Suggestions:

    You can add a mouse movement listener that allows your ship to follow the players' mouse.

Cool things:
-Love the barrier idea!
-Very well defined controls

Clarifying Qs:
- For the projectiles, do you not need both an x and a y coordinate to keep track of its location on the graph? In other words, a 2D array instead of 1D?
-What exactly does int facing do?

Suggestions:
-Perhaps separate the classes for the enemy and the player spaceships since they move differently?
-Maybe define win/lose conditions better?
